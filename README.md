IntelliJ Tool Windows Actions Plugin
====================================

This IntelliJ plugin adds just one action to IntelliJ:
- **Hide Bottom Tool Windows** (Ctrl+ESC) \
  Hides all bottom tool windows at once.
  
The plugin should work on all IDEA applications, ie. PyCharm, Resharper
etc., but only IntelliJ IDEA has been tested.

This plugin is a fork of the [SimpleActions plugin](https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/207-simpleactions/)
by Etienne Studer. It has exactly the same action, but it also bundles
some other actions, which don't work anymore and produce errors. It's
not maintained anymore.
